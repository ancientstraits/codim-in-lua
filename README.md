# Codim, in Lua
This is a version of `codim` which itself is written in `lua` and uses the `ffmpeg` command line tools instead of the C libraries.
I am creating this version because trying to use the C libraries and writing a C program was too hard and time-consuming, and I actually want to upload videos.
[Codim in C](https://github.com/ancientstraits/codim) is far from a lost cause, however. Once I am comfortable with this version, and my mind is clear, 
I can take on the challenge of finishing the C program.
